# Coursera_Capstone
The data that I will be using is the data of NYC. I will use the data required from Coursera to determine clusters of areas with more famous ethnic food, such as Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Hispanic food. 

I will use the datas givenn by coursera from this link: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset 

What I will do to the data is:

1. Slice the region, and we will only use the data around Manhattan borough. 
2. Classify the neighborhood
3. Using Foursquare API, determine the most common ethnic cuisines does people around the area eats.
