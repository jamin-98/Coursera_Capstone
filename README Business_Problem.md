Data Science can be used to determine the best solution to various problem. It can be used for healthcare, in which medical practitioner could use Data Science to determine what prescription should be given to the patient, and many more. Today, we will use Data Science and Foursquare API, and we will use both of them to determine which region around Manhattan eats more ethnic food, and which ethnic food is more popular around these areas. I am thinking of categorizing the clusters into four groups, which is Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Hispanic food, but I might add some more category later on.

We will look at the frequency of visits from various areas, and we will cluster the regions into various clusters. This data can help businesspeople to determine whether it is profitable to set up a new restaurant around the area. This data could be useful to them because it can determine the competitiveness of certain ethnic food around the area, while also reveals the majority of ethnic population to a certain degrees. It can also be used to predict the trends around the areas too.
